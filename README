This Rails plugin makes it super simple to add filtering to your rails list views.

Some of the features:
---------------------

* RESTful
* conditions, sorting, maybe grouping?
* works with pagination
* settings can be persisted during session or via database for saved searches

Here is some code:
------------------

In your model:

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_filter_settings
end

Possibilities:
-------------

* integrate with thinking_sphinx
* integrate with formtastic


Here is how it works:
---------------------

Filterrific relies heavily on scopes. Each filter dimension has its own scope. Filterrific makes it easy to shuttle user settings to your controllers and models for queries, and back to the views.
