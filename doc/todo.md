To make it work on Rails 3.1:

* follow kaminari gem for recipe
* implement new model api
* leave view and controller as is
* bump version to 1.0.0 (not backwards compatible)

Later:
* build filterrific-recipes on github wiki
* update readme
* update view and controller apis


# Implementation Plan for Filterrific
